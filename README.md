# GAN_for_Handwritte_Digits.

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic images of handwritten digits (0-9). The architecture comprises two main components: the generator and the discriminator, both utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for effective image processing.

Generator: The generator takes random noise as input and processes it through several layers of transposed convolution (deconvolution) to produce images that resemble handwritten digits. The architecture includes activation functions like ReLU and leaky ReLU to introduce non-linearity, and Batch Normalization is applied to stabilize training.

Discriminator: The discriminator acts as a classifier that distinguishes between real handwritten digits from a dataset (such as MNIST) and the synthetic images generated by the generator. It consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, using activation functions like Leaky ReLU to enhance its ability to detect subtle differences between real and generated images.

Training Process: The GAN is trained through a two-step process: first, the discriminator is trained to accurately classify real and fake images, and then the generator is trained to improve its ability to create realistic digit images that can fool the discriminator. This adversarial training loop continues until the generator produces high-quality images indistinguishable from real handwritten digits.

Evaluation: The performance of the GAN is evaluated by visual inspection of generated images and quantitative measures such as Inception Score (IS) and Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) to assess the quality and diversity of the generated digits.

This GAN implementation demonstrates the effectiveness of CNNs in generating high-quality images, providing insights into the capabilities of generative models in the realm of image synthesis.
